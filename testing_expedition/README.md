## Exploring Expeditions

Exploring the Smithsonian’s Open Access data and the Institution's history made me wonder where specimens like corals or fossils came from and how they got to their current holding museum in DC. This project investigates the contributions of scientific expeditions to the Smithsonian’s collections, exploring questions such as: Which expeditions yielded the most specimens, artifacts, and archival materials? What categories do these materials belong to (e.g., fossils, botany, minerals)? Using a quantitative dataset, it highlights the diversity of artifacts collected by expeditions like the U.S. Exploring Expedition (1838–1842), which yielded hundreds of specimens across vertebrate zoology, invertebrate zoology, botany, and more.

A stacked bar chart visualizes the diversity of material collected by each expedition, with bar heights representing the quantity of artifacts in specific categories. This chart connects to a vertical timeline, illustrating the progression of expeditions and their contributions over time. Upon selecting an expedition, users see information about its goals and a snapshot of images showcasing collected artifacts, enabling comparisons and assessments of how well the expedition met its objectives. By combining visualizations, images, and quantitative analysis, this project offers a dynamic view of the interplay between history, science, and preservation, illuminating underrepresented aspects of expeditionary contributions.

## Exploring Expeditions Process 
[Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16QyoU5pXi25KyBFgINcCdsgFQZ_5GubsRPRdHZ4W134/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to Data Management and Data Tracker which stores the results and initial analysis of searching the term "expedition" across museum units.
Process included
1) Initial Researching with Expeditions were High Yielding
2) getting lists of expedition names in each unit
2) create an object and sorting them by their count
3) repeating for each unit
4) picking the top yielding expeditions over time
5) Selecting images for each expedition
